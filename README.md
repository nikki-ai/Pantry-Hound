# Pantry Hound

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App

This app lets you log all of your household foods and their calorie count and set a daily calorie limit for yourself. When you press a button "Fetch my food" It generates a list of your available foods that you can eat before you reach your cal. limit. As the day goes on and you are closer to your cal. limit the list gets more refined.
